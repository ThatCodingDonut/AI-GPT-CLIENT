# OpenAI CLI Chat Client

A simple terminal chat client for OpenAI. Pick any model on your account, chat back and forth, save conversations, and pick them back up later. The system prompt lives in `prompt.md` so you can tweak it whenever.

## Setup

1. Install deps:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Add your API key — either export it or drop it in a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

3. Run it:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## What it does

- Lists all available chat models on your account and lets you pick one
- Streams responses so you're not sitting there waiting
- Keeps full conversation memory so the model actually remembers what you said
- System prompt is in `prompt.md` — edit it however you want, then `/reload` in the chat
- Save and load chats as JSON files in the `chats/` folder

## Commands

| Command    | What it does                        |

| `/history` | Print the conversation so far       |
